Figure 2. The top panel illustrates the distribution of prediction metrics of the age-prediction models across 5000 random train-test split iterations: a) Correlation between predicted and actual age. b) Age-prediction bias. c) Mean absolute error. d) Mean absolute error after correcting for the age-prediction bias. The bottom panel depicts the distribution of ridge regression coefficients in the e) cognitive age-prediction and f) physical age-prediction models across 5000 random train-test split iterations. To facilitate interpretations, some of the coefficients for the predictors were sign-flipped (i.e., multiply by -1), such that for all predictors, a positive coefficient would suggest poorer performance corresponding to increasing age. The means of the distributions are illustrated as horizontal and vertical lines in the top and bottom panels, respectively.

Figure 6. Chord diagrams showing the SC and FC averaged connectivity values between and within different regions, associated with the three behavioral measures with the highest and lowest RMSEold/RMSEyoung ratios in the combined SC and rsFC model. The list of nodes corresponding to various regions in the SC and FC networks can be referred to in table 3 of Rolls et al. (2015) and at https://atlas.brainnetome.org/bnatlas.html, respectively.

Figure 2. Partial correlation networks depicting items from the geriatric depression scale, geriatric anxiety inventory and the friendship scale at (a) Pre-COVID-19 and (b) lockdown. Differences across time in edges values are presented in the (c) Lockdown—Pre-COVID-19 network. Only the edges with significant changes (uncorrected p \> 0.05) across time, as determined by the paired network comparison test, are shown. “Positive association” and “Negative association” in the context of (c) meant that the edges became more positive or negative, respectively, across time. Thicker lines corresponded to stronger associations.

Figure 1. Chord diagram illustrating the changes in neurocognitive diagnoses across time among individuals diagnosed with MCI at baseline. The chord diagram is generated using the data reported in a follow-up study (Michaud, Su, Siahpush, & Murman, 2017) of 1,415 MCI subjects (average follow-up = 4.3 years). The width of the links corresponds to the proportion of subjects, within their respective MCI subtypes. The proportion of the sectors representing the MCI subtypes not linked to any subsequent changes in diagnoses correspond to the proportion of subjects remaining at the same diagnosis at follow-up. ‘Other dementias’ include frontotemporal lobe dementia, vascular dementia, Lewy bodies dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and mixed dementias.
