#### Yu Junhong— Assistant Professor of Psychology

PhD, The University of Hong Kong\
Research interests: My research makes use of multimodal neuroimaging to study neuropsychology and cognitive aging in general. In particular, I am interested neurocognitive disorders, superior cognitive aging, neural predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive enhancement interventions

#### Charly Billaud— Research Fellow

PhD (Neurosciences), Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom\
Research interests: Translational research involving neuropsychology and neuroimaging, including structural/functional MRI, DTI, and MEG. I have a particular interest in both aging and paediatric clinical populations with neurological disorders and developing markers of cognition and behaviour. My work involves structural and functional network analyses and graph theory.

#### Dexter Chew— Research Assistant

BA (Psychology), University at Buffalo\
Research interests: My research interests are in topics such as Mental Health of Elderly Patients, Elder Abuse with Long-Lasting Psychological consequences as well as Psychosocial Development of Criminals. I became interested in the mental health aspects of the elderly stemming from 2 years of working in the non-profit sector as well as being an active member of the grassroots level in Singapore. This has helped establish the different views and interests in the elderly being overlooked or becoming a marginalized group of individuals in society. Further interests in criminal psychosocial developments stemmed from an interest in reading serial killer bibliographies and documentaries that have led to a fascination of how the minds of hardened criminals are like.

#### Dionis Chong— Research Assistant

BA in Psychology, Dublin Business School\
Research interests: The general scope of my research interests include topics on creativity, intelligence and interpersonal relationships. Having been a gig musician for most of my life, the function of creativity relating to mental health and function as always been on the forefront of my curiosity. The skillset I’ve attained through learning how research is done in college allows me to pursue this question through a proper scientific means. I did my undergraduate thesis on Romantic Passion and Emotional Intelligence through Attachment Styles between the two biological sexes, which jumpstarted my interest in the inner workings of interpersonal relationships and how they relate to intelligence and mental functions. I hope to gain more skills within the neuroscientific sphere while working in this lab to enhance the quality of my research into these topics in the future.

#### Lee Zheng Long— FYP student

Research Interests: I am interested in understanding the pathology of affective disorders and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. I seek to do so using neuroimaging methods, like structural, functional and diffusion MRI. Specifically, I use approaches like network neuroscience, DTI, and fixel-based analysis. I am also curious about the value of these neuroimaging markers as predictors of AD progression.

Isaac Teo— URECA student Research Interests: My interests are in the mechanisms of cognitive decline in ageing and its associated social, emotional, and behavioural outcomes. I am also interested in the development of interventions that delay cognitive decline and optimise brain health to preserve functions and maintain dignified ageing.
