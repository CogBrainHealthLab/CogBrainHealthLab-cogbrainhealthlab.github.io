I became interested in the mental health aspects of the elderly stemming from 2 years of working in the non-profit sector as well as being an active member of the grassroots level in Singapore. This has helped establish the different views and interests in the elderly being overlooked or becoming a marginalized group of individuals in society. Further interests in criminal psychosocial developments stemmed from an interest in reading serial killer bibliographies and documentaries that have led to a fascination of how the minds of hardened criminals are like.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n![](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/cogbrainhealthlab/files/2023/08/dionis_cropped-230x230.jpg){width=\"150\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n#### Dionis Chong— Research Assistant\n\nBA in Psychology, Dublin Business School\\\nResearch interests: The general scope of my research interests include topics on creativity, intelligence and interpersonal relationships. Having been a gig musician for most of my life, the function of creativity relating to mental health and function as always been on the forefront of my curiosity. The skillset I’ve attained through learning how research is done in college allows me to pursue this question through a proper scientific means. I did my undergraduate thesis on Romantic Passion and Emotional Intelligence through Attachment Styles between the two biological sexes, which jumpstarted my interest in the inner workings of interpersonal relationships and how they relate to intelligence and mental functions. I hope to gain more skills within the neuroscientific sphere while working in this lab to enhance the quality of my research into these topics in the future.\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Graduate students**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n![](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/cogbrainhealthlab/files/2021/10/Savannah2.jpg){width=\"150\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n#### Savannah Siew— PhD student\n\nB.Soc.Sci (Psychology), National University of Singapore\\\nResearch interests: Neuropsychology, mindfulness, clinical psychology\n:::\n:::\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n![](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/cogbrainhealthlab/files/2023/12/Janice_cropped.jpg){width=\"150\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n#### Janice Koi— PhD student\n\nB.A. Hons (Psychology), Nanyang Technological University\\\nResearch Interests: I am interested in using multimodal neuroimaging techniques to study the neurocognitive mechanisms of healthy aging.\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Undergraduate students**\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n![](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/cogbrainhealthlab/files/2024/08/Kayla_cropped-230x230.jpg){width=\"150\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n#### Kayla Tan— FYP student\n\nResearch Interests: I am interested in the inseparable role brain functions have in psychological phenomenon, particularly ADHD; anxiety and depression.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"20%\"}\n![](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/cogbrainhealthlab/files/2024/08/Lee-Zheng-Long_cropped-230x230.jpg){width=\"150\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"80%\"}\n#### Lee Zheng Long— FYP student\n\nResearch Interests: I am interested in understanding the pathology of affective disorders and neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer’s disease.
